=head1 NAME

Device::Chip::MAX31855 - chip driver for MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::Chip::MAX31855;
    my $chip = Device::Chip:MAX31855->new;
    $chip->mount(Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new)->get;
    
    my $temp = $chip->read_thermocouple()->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Device::Chip::MAX31855 communicates with the MAX31855 SPI thermocouple amplifier.

The MAX31855 is a digital thermocouple amplifier and converter
containing a thermocouple measurement circuit, cold junction
compensator, and digital SPI interface. It provides temperature
measurements of an attached K-type thermocouple and the local cold
junction sensor, and can detect faults such as open circuit and short
to ground (reading faults is not implemented yet).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 read_thermocouple

Returns the termperature of the attached thermocouple in degrees Celsius.

=head2 read_cold_junction

Returns the temperature of the local (cold) junction in degrees Celsius.
